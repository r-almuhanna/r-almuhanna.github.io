## Why this blog?

The aim behind this is to keep it to myself. Nowadays, every time I listen to *"Million Years Ago,"* this part hits me hard:
<br>
> "I know I'm not the only one  
> Who regrets the things they've done  
> Sometimes I just feel it's only me  
> Who can't stand the reflection that they see  
> I wish I could live a little more  
> Look up to the sky, not just the floor  
> I feel like my life is flashing by  
> And all I can do is watch and cry"

<br>

I believe these lyrics accurately describe who I was. As a child—I expected more of myself but never became the person I envisioned. Lately, I’ve been reflecting on why that is, and it seems to boil down to two things: **not taking action** and **not building mental toughness**. That realization is what prompted me to write this blog.
<br>
  



I also wonder whether my current motivation comes from external influences or still stems from within. Dr. Mazin discussed **self-motivation theory**, and I’m certain that as a child, my drive was entirely internal. I hope that remains the case—or that I learn to cultivate it that way.

My **four-year plan** echoes Badi’s vision: never to look back and say, “I could have done more. I had more potential.” I have lived with that regret before, and I refuse to let it happen again.

## Main theme

Currently, I'm planning to focus on building **toughness** and **taking action** as the main categories to hold me accountable. Additionally, I'll include a "random" category for any thoughts or experiences I feel the need to share or keep to myself.
